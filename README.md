.

Add your Flutter app (Android: add package name, download google-services.json; iOS: download GoogleService-Info.plist).

Enable Email/Password Authentication in Firebase → Authentication → Sign-in method.

Create a Firestore database (start in Test Mode for development).

⚡ Flutter Setup

Install Firebase packages in pubspec.yaml:

firebase_core
firebase_auth
